**Project Description**

This data analysis project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python and libraries Pandas and Matplotlib but mostly Pandas. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations based on the provided sales dataset.

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data

**Sequential order of steps:**

**1.Data Exploration:**
The code begins by loading the sales dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
It displays the first few rows, checks the dataset's shape, examines the data types and non-null values, and provides summary statistics for numerical columns.

**2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
The code handles missing values by dropping rows that contain any missing data.
Duplicate rows, if any, are removed from the dataset.
Data types are transformed as necessary, such as converting the 'ORDERDATE' column to a datetime format.

**3.Data Analysis:**
The code performs analysis tasks on the dataset.
It calculates the total sales by product line.
It identifies the product line with the highest sales.

**4.Data Visualization:**

The code utilizes Matplotlib to create informative visualizations. It generates various charts and plots to represent sales trends, product performance, customer segments, and geographical distribution of sales.
The visualizations include:
a.Sales Trends over Time
b.Product Performance
c.Customer Segments
d.Geographical Distribution of Sales

**Output:**

The code and the generated output provide insights into sales trends, product performance, customer segments, and geographical distribution of sales. Users can use these insights to make data-driven decisions and strategies to improve sales and revenue.
The repository includes Python script, Jupyter notebook file with the output, input CSV file (sales_data.csv), and the output CSV file (sales_data_output.csv).
